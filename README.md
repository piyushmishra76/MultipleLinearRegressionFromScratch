# MultipleLinearRegressionFromScratch
Multiple Linear Regression from scratch — includes mathematical formulation, Python implementation, regression metrics, and detailed study notes.

This project demonstrates the complete mathematical formulation and implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** — built entirely from scratch using Python.  
The goal is to understand how the model learns parameters (weights and intercept) without relying on pre-built libraries.

Along with the implementation, this repository also includes **detailed notes** explaining the **mathematical derivation** of Multiple Linear Regression — making it ideal for beginners who want to connect theory with code.

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks and supporting notes:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression (From Scratch):**  
   - Mathematical derivation of the regression equation  
   - Step-by-step parameter calculation (slope and intercept) finding betas
   - Manual implementation using NumPy  
   - Comparison with Scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression` results  

2. **Regression Metrics Evaluation:**  
   - Implementation and explanation of the following metrics:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - R² Score
     - Adjusted R² Score  
   - Performance comparison between scratch implementation and sklearn model

3. **Notes (Mathematical Formulation):**  
   - Covers theoretical foundation and step-by-step derivation of formulas  
   - Includes explanation of closed-form solution and error minimization process  
   - Ideal for learners who want to bridge **math + implementation**

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses the **Diabetes dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which includes 10 baseline variables such as age, BMI, and blood pressure to predict disease progression.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand the **mathematics behind Multiple Linear Regression**
- Derive model parameters using **Closed Form Solution**
- Learn to compute regression metrics manually
- Build confidence before exploring advanced ML algorithms
- Strengthen both **conceptual** and **implementation** understanding

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results
Although the accuracy is modest (as expected for scratch-built models), the implementation successfully replicates the regression process both **mathematically** and **programmatically**.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add Gradient Descent-based solution  
- Visualize regression planes  
- Extend metrics to include Adjusted RMSE and Variance Score
